title: mKingdom TryHackMe writeup

mKingdom is advertised as an easy, beginner-friendly room, but I have some reservations about this claim. While standard methods will get you started, there are several rabbit holes that can mislead you. Although initial progress might seem straightforward, obtaining the user and especially the root flag can be quite challenging for beginners. I suspect this box may be reclassified as a medium difficulty in the future.

# Enumeration
This first step should be very obvious when you start. Start the machine and Nmap that boy!
