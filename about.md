Welcome! I'm thrilled to have you here. My name is Rien Strootman, and I'm a mathematics teacher from the Netherlands with a unique background in cybersecurity. For 1.5 years, I worked as a SOC analyst, diving deep into the world of cyber threats and defenses. Despite returning to my roots in education, my passion for offensive security remains strong. This blog is a fusion of my love for teaching and cybersecurity, designed to guide you into the fascinating realm of Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges.

### How to Make the Most of This Blog
Each write-up on this blog is crafted to take you step-by-step towards the solution of various CTF challenges. I aim to help you develop the mindset of a successful CTF competitor, encouraging critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Here's how to use this blog effectively:

* Read Carefully: As you progress through each write-up, I'll gradually narrow down the possibilities, helping you to think independently before revealing the solution.
* Challenge Yourself: Donâ€™t rush to the end. If you find yourself stuck, take a moment to struggle and explore different approaches. This is where real learning happens.
* Seek Guidance When Needed: If you're truly stuck, I'll provide the solution, but try to solve the problem on your own first.

Remember, the goal is not just to find the solution but to understand the process and develop a hacker's mindset. Happy hacking!
